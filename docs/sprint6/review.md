# Sprint 6 Review 14.04.2023

## Demo
- Demonstrated the firmware uploading from cloud to bridging server to the device.

## Progress during sprint
- Cloudification still in progress
- Most of the progress was related to a working bridging server.
- Image labeling is now considered done. New task for uploading images from device to bridging/cloud.
- RPI pico tasks are kind of stuck for the moment due to undefined behaviour on-device.
- Device identification is working outside of docker.
- two different use cases done i.e. two datasets.

## Next Sprint Goals
- Not much time, we have to prioritize the tasks.
- Uploading images to cloud from device is not highest priority right now for the remaining weeks.
- What's needed for the remaining weeks is an end-to-end demo.
- Ngrok as a plan B for huggingface.
- Ability to switch models and devices. This depends on the RPI pico support tasks.
- Unified UI design to make the UI look more polished.
- UI rework needs to be done for the demo.
- Backlog will prioritized for the remaining weeks.
