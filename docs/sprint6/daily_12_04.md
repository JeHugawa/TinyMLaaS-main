- Arttu figuring out how to implement the relay server.
- Borna and Matias still figuring out how to see devices from docker.
- Leevi did some work regarding RPI pico inferencing code.
- Nella has been working with s3 credentials etc.

## Misc.

- Does the relay server need to be ran in docker? Would simplify detecting devices via usb ports.
- Huggingface support for storing secrets (i.e., s3 credentials) ?
