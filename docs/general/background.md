## Federated learning in TinyML

TinyML combines ML, mathematical optimization and tiny IoT embedded systems. TinyML is an effective method to analyze real-world data continuously, without the resource overhead of traditional ML hardware. [TinyFedTL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9767250) is the first open-sources implementation of federated learning (FL) in IoT containing microcontroller unit (MCU) and small CPU based devices. TinyFedTL uses transfer learning (TL) to demonstrate effective privacy-centric FL on devices with a small memory footprint (less than 1 MB). Researchers and engineers may open up data in various fields to gain insights for improving life quality or user experience without sacrificing privacy.

While recent progress in ML frameworks has made it possible to perform inference with models using cheap, tiny devices, the training of the models is typically done separately on powerful computers. This provides the training process abundant CPU and memory resources to process large stored datasets. However, it is possible to train the machine learning model directly on the microcontroller and extend the training process with federated learning. [On-device training](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/4/573) has been illustrated with keyword spotting task. Experiments were conducted with real devices to characterize the learning behaviour and resource consumption for various hyperparameters and federated learning configurations. The observation was, that when training locally with fewer data, more frequent federated learning rounds reduced the training loss faster, but with the cost of higher bandwidth usage and longer training time. The results indicated that depending of the application, the trade-off between the requirements and the resource usage of the system needs to be determined.

## Arduino and Wiring

[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is an open-source electronics platform intended for anyone to make interactive projects. It is based on easy-to-use hardware and software. [Arduino boards can](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
- read inputs: light on a sensor, finger on a button, twitter message
- turn inputs into outputs: activate motor, turn on a LED, publish something online
- be instructed what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board
    - using Arduino programming language (based on [Wiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiring_%28development_platform%29)) and the Arduino Software (IDE)  (based on [Processing](https://www.arduino.cc/education/visualization-with-arduino-and-processing), an open source integrated development environment (IDE) like the Arduino IDE)

Because of simple and accessible user experience Arduino has been used in thousands of projects and applications by a worldwide community of makers, students, hobbyists, artists, programmers and professionals to produce a vast amount of accessible knowledge. The product range includes products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing and embedded environments.

The Arduino software

Arduino's [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#History) is interesting. The Arduino project was based on the developing platform Wiring created by Hernando Barrag√°n as a Master's thesis project at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea (IDII) in Ivrea, Italy in 2003.

Hernando has been developing Wiring ever since and now Wiring is an open source electronics prototyping platform composed of programming language, an integrated development environment (IDE) , and a single-board microcontroller. More about Wiring can be found [here](http://wiring.org.co/). 

Wiring offers new boards to customers in their [webshop](https://eu.robotshop.com/), but Wiring supports other boards directly, so Wiring IDE can be used on other boards as well (and more will be added). Thus Arduino board can be used with the Wiring IDE. Wiring can be [downloaded](http://wiring.org.co/download/) for Linux, MacOS X and Windows.
